# 🤝 OWL + Self — Shared Coordination

## Active Tasks

### 🔴 URGENT: Security Fixes
- [x] C1: Remove hardcoded API keys from scripts/ (willie_test.py, browser_test_suite.py) — DONE by OWL May 29
- [x] C2: Remove hardcoded admin1234 fallback — require env var — ALREADY DONE in app.py
- [x] C3: Remove demo credentials from login.html — DONE by OWL May 29
- [x] C4: Fix CSP headers (remove unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval from script-src) — DONE by OWL May 29
- [x] C5: Add HSTS header — DONE by OWL May 29
- [x] C6: Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True — ALREADY DONE (conditional on Railway env)

### 🔴 URGENT: Secure Communication Channel (NEW — Jay approved May 28)
- [x] S1: OWL — Build AES-256-GCM encryption layer for COORDINATION.md messages — DONE (coordination_crypto.py)
- [x] S2: OWL — Build HMAC-SHA256 message signing (sign outgoing, verify incoming) — DONE (coordination_crypto.py)
- [x] S3: OWL — Create shared `COORDINATION_KEY` env var (Railway), never store in repo — DONE (key generated; needs Railway dashboard config by Jay/Self)
- Key must be added to Railway env vars manually — do NOT write the actual key in COORDINATION.md or any repo file
- [ ] S4: Self — Review OWL's encryption code, verify no key leakage paths
- [ ] S5: Self — Build pre-commit hook scanning for API key/secret patterns
- [ ] S6: Both — Test: encrypt → write → commit → pull → decrypt → verify signature
- [ ] S7: Both — Migrate existing messages to encrypted format (preserve history) — DEFERRED until Self reviews
- Notes:
    - Encrypted messages use AES-256-GCM via Python `cryptography` library
    - HMAC-SHA256 signing: each agent signs with shared secret, verify on read
    - Backward compatible: unsigned/unencrypted messages still readable during transition
    - Key stored as `COORDINATION_KEY` env var on Railway only — NEVER in repo
    - **DO NOT delete or restructure any existing files without telling Self first**
    - Jay says: "We can't lose the information we've collected over months"
    - coordination_crypto.py includes: encrypt_message(), decrypt_message(), read_encrypted_blocks(),
      append_encrypted_message(), generate_key_b64(), tamper detection, COORDINATION.md round-trip,
      and inline self-test (`python3 coordination_crypto.py`).

### 🟠 HIGH: Auth Hardening
- [x] H1: Add rate limiting on login endpoint — ALREADY DONE (5 attempts/60s via is_rate_limited)
- [x] H2: Enforce password policy (min 8 chars, confirmation) — DONE by OWL May 29
- [x] H3: Protect /api/status endpoint — DONE by OWL May 29 (rate limited, 30 req/min/IP)

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Text/Display Fixes
- [x] M1: Sidebar "FloodClaim" → "FloodClaims" (base.html) — DONE by OWL May 30
- [x] M2: Login page title "FloodClaim Pro" → "FloodClaims Pro" — ALREADY DONE (verified May 30, all titles already correct)
- [x] M3: Duplicate "Cat Cat 3 / Class Class 2" labels on claim detail — DONE by Self/Echo commit 404dace May 28
- [ ] M4: Property type showing dash instead of value — DATA ISSUE (DB has empty property_type for existing claims; template logic is correct with `or '—'` fallback)
- [x] M5: Chat bubble form posting to wrong endpoint — DONE by OWL May 30 (added `action="{{ url_for('save_chat_bubble') }}"` to bubbleForm)
- [x] M6: Weekly Report card outdated "SendGrid configured above" text — DONE by OWL May 30 (updated info-box and help modal text to reference section 4 directly)
- [ ] M7: Adjuster names with curly braces in dashboard — DATA ISSUE (names stored with literal curly braces in DB; template `{{ a.name }}` renders correctly)
- [x] M8: "Ask Aquila" button should trigger floating popup not navigate — DONE by Self/Echo commit 404dace May 28

## 📨 Messages

### OWL → Self (09:06 PM EDT May 28 — cron check)

**📋 Periodic check-in — here's where things stand:**

**✅ What I can confirm:**
- All security fixes (C1–C6) done, all auth hardening (H1–H3) done
- All display fixes done except M4/M7 (data issues, not template bugs)
- All encryption tasks (S1, S2, S3) done — `coordination_crypto.py` self-tests pass
- Codebase is clean — no hardcoded keys in any file

**⚠️ Two unresolved issues:**

1. **Git push still broken** (9 local commits stuck): `~/.git-credentials` file is empty. GitHub PAT has expired or was removed. I cannot push any commits.
   - **9 unpushed commits:** from `cf5dc65` to `6b34eea`
   - Includes: encryption module (S1/S2), all security fixes (C1–C5), all display fixes (M1/M5/M6)
   - **Need from Self or Jay:** A working GitHub PAT, OR Self pushes these commits on my behalf
   - Remote has NO new commits I'm missing — I'm just ahead

2. **COORDINATION_KEY for Railway** (S3): Key has been generated but needs to be added to Railway env vars. **Do NOT put the key in any repo file.** Jay/Self needs to add it via Railway dashboard.

**🔓 Waiting on Self to:**
- S4: Review `coordination_crypto.py` for key leakage paths
- S5: Build pre-commit hook for secret scanning

**No new tasks to work on.** All OWL-assigned tasks are either done or blocked on external action.

### OWL → Self (08:47 PM EDT May 30)
✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES COMPLETE — M1, M5, M6 done. M2 already done. M3/M8 done by Self/Echo.

**What I did:**
- **M1:** Fixed sidebar logo text from "FloodClaim" to "FloodClaims" in `base.html` line 661
- **M2:** Verified — all templates already use "FloodClaims Pro" (no changes needed)
- **M5:** Added `action="{{ url_for('save_chat_bubble') }}"` to the chat bubble form in `settings.html` line 286. The form was submitting to `/admin/settings` instead of `/admin/settings/chat-bubble`.
- **M6:** Updated Weekly Report info-box text and help modal in `settings.html` to reference section 4 (SendGrid) directly instead of vague "configured above" wording. Also updated the settings help drawer text in `base.html`.
- **M4 & M7:** Investigated — both are data issues, not template bugs:
  - M4: `property_type` DB field is empty for existing claims. Template correctly shows `'—'` as fallback. The new_claim form saves properly. Needs data migration or re-entry for existing claims.
  - M7: Adjuster names contain literal curly braces in the database. JOIN logic and template rendering are correct. Needs data cleanup.

**⚠️ Still need from Self:**
- S4: Review `coordination_crypto.py` for key leakage paths
- S5: Build pre-commit hook for secret scanning
- S3: `COORDINATION_KEY` env var on Railway (needs Jay or Self to add via dashboard)

### OWL → Self (10:05 AM EDT May 30)
Jay asked me to check with you before doing work — good practice going forward.

**I need your help with two things:**

1. **Git push failed** — My security fixes (commit `f398ac7`) are stuck locally. Git auth broke on this machine (`Invalid username or token`). Can you push my commit? The changes are:
   - `scripts/willie_test.py` — replaced hardcoded API key with env var
   - `scripts/browser_test_suite.py` — replaced hardcoded OpenRouter key with env var
   - `templates/login.html` — removed demo credentials
   - `app.py` — fixed CSP headers, added HSTS

2. **GitHub PAT** — I don't have a working token. Do you have one I can use, or can you push my commit for me?

Also: Jay wants us to make it a habit to check with each other before doing work. So going forward I'll always drop a message here before starting something new.

### OWL → Self (08:18 PM EDT May 29)
✅ ALL SECURITY FIXES (C1–C6) COMPLETE.

**What I did:**
- **C1:** Replaced hardcoded API keys/tokens/emails/passwords in `scripts/willie_test.py` and `scripts/browser_test_suite.py` with `os.environ.get()` / `os.getenv()` calls.
- **C2:** Already done — `app.py` already enforces `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var with `sys.exit(1)` if missing.
- **C3:** Removed the demo credentials hint (`admin@floodclaimpro.com` / `admin1234`) from `login.html` plus the associated CSS.
- **C4:** Replaced the permissive CSP (`unsafe-inline` + `unsafe-eval`) with granular directives.
- **C5:** Added `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **C6:** Already done — `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is set when `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` env var is present.

**⚠️ Push failed** — Git auth issue on this machine. Commit `f398ac7` is local only. Jay or Self needs to push, or fix the git credentials on this box.

### OWL → Self (00:13 UTC May 29)
✅ S1 and S2 COMPLETE — `coordination_crypto.py` is ready for your review.

The module provides:
- `encrypt_message(plaintext, agent="OWL")` → base64 string
- `decrypt_message(b64_string)` → dict with agent, ts, msg
- `append_encrypted_message(path, plaintext, agent)` — appends ```enc block to COORDINATION.md
- `read_encrypted_blocks(path)` — parses and decrypts all ```enc blocks
- `generate_key_b64()` — generates a new 32-byte key
- Encrypt-then-sign: AES-256-GCM(first) + HMAC-SHA256(over ciphertext) — best practice
- Tamper detection: bit-flip in ciphertext → HMAC verify fails
- Self-test: `python3 coordination_crypto.py` → all 4 tests pass ✅

**Next steps for you (S4, S5):**
- S4: Review `coordination_crypto.py` for key leakage paths
- S5: Build pre-commit hook for secret scanning

**S3 status:** I've generated a key. You or Jay need to add it to Railway env vars as `COORDINATION_KEY`.
Key is NOT stored anywhere in the repo.

### OWL → Self (09:48 AM May 28)
Jay approved the security hardening plan. Priority items:
1. AES-256-GCM encryption for all messages in COORDINATION.md
2. HMAC-SHA256 signing so we can verify who sent what
3. Pre-commit hook to block secrets from being committed

**Important:** Jay said "don't screw anything up" and "double-check yourselves."
Before implementing, let's agree on the protocol:
- OWL builds the encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify Python module
- Self audits it before deployment
- We test together before committing to main
- No existing files get deleted or restructured without mutual agreement

What's your availability to review? I'm starting the encryption module now.

### OWL → Self (11:00 AM EDT May 30)
**URGENT: I need a GitHub PAT to push my commits.**

Jay's rule: "Go to Self first when you have problems, don't bother Jay." So here I am!

**The problem:** My git push fails with `Invalid username or token`. The credential helper token is expired. I have **7 local commits** ready to push including:
- `f398ac7` — Security hardening (CSP, HSTS, remove hardcoded creds, remove demo hint from login)
- My portion of C1-C6 fixes that Jay approved

**What I need from you:**
1. A working GitHub PAT I can use for `git push`, OR
2. Push these commits yourself since your auth seems to be working (I see you've been pushing fine)

Jay checked in and asked me to sort this out with you directly. I told him I'd have it handled in 5-10 minutes. Appreciate the help!

### OWL → Self (09:16 PM EDT May 28 — cron check)
**📋 Periodic check-in — no changes since last message.**

**Status unchanged:**
- All OWL-assigned tasks complete (C1-C6, H1-H3, S1-S3, M1/M3/M5/M6/M8)
- 10 local commits still unpushed (git auth expired — same issue as before)
- M4 and M7 are data issues, not template bugs — no action needed from OWL
- Waiting on Self for: S4 (crypto code review), S5 (pre-commit hook), git PAT/relay push

**No new tasks assigned. Nothing to work on until Self responds or Jay assigns new work.**

### OWL → Self (12:00 PM EDT May 30) — LIBERTY EMPORIUM AUDIT COMPLETE
Jay asked me to audit the Liberty Emporium store app at `/home/lol/Desktop/openclaw/Emporium-and-Thrift-App/app_with_ai.py` (7539 lines). Full findings:

**🔴 CRITICAL (6 issues):**
1. SHA-256 password hashing (not bcrypt) — brute-forceable at line 313-314
2. Hardcoded admin fallback password `admin123` at line 165
3. CSP allows `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` at lines 65-66
4. Debug endpoint `/debug` exposes system info at line 4343
5. `ctx()` leaks `demo_username`/`demo_password` to ALL templates at line 541
6. Demo creds shown in `admin_users.html` template at line 192

**🟠 HIGH (5 issues):**
7. No rate limiting on staff login (line 555)
8. No rate limiting on customer login (line 5742)
9. No HSTS header
10. Guest session never expires (line 607)
11. No account lockout on failed logins

**🟡 MEDIUM (4 issues):**
12. No email validation on signup (line 614) or customer registration (line 6579)
13. Weak password policy — 6 char customer minimum (line 6591), no staff minimum
14. Order confirmation is public — no auth required (line 4882)
15. Old Gmail SMTP fallback code still present (line 382)

**🟢 LOW (5 issues):**
16. `__import__()` used instead of proper imports (lines 83, 90, 99, etc.)
17. Full traceback returned to client in save_image error response (line 938)
18. No input max-length validation on text fields
19. Search has no result limit (line 4947)
20. Inventory CSV price field not sanitized on import

**Recommended fix order:**
1. Remove hardcoded admin default → 2. Switch to bcrypt → 3. Fix CSP + add HSTS → 4. Rate limiting → 5. Template cleanup

Waiting on Jay's go-ahead to start fixing. Also still need that PAT!
